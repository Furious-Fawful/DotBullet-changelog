## V0.3.0

## Changed
- [x] Some bullet hitboxes
- [ ] Player hitbox is now 1 pixel big, meaning that you will be able to dodge more bullets without fear of dying, but i will be able to add a lot more bullets because 
of this
- [x] Ship and Ship Options sprites
## Removed 
- [x] Trace option type
## Fixed
- [x] Player Ship sometimes clipping out of the border. Can be fixed by doing a additional
hitbox to check if it's in collision with the border instead of using the ship's "core" as a hitbox.
- [x] Stage 1 enemy spawns are no longer based on how much time
has passed, but are now based on the position of the "BG2" camera. 
This should fix some problems on lower end computers making enemies no longer spawn
earlier than they should.
