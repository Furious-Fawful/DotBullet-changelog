# DotBullet Change Log

This can also serve as the road map for the new version.

## V0.3.0

## Added
- [ ] Stage 3
- [x] In-game achievements
- [x] New ui for the start menu and weapon select
- [x] Novice mode
- [ ] Heaven Breaker, stage 3 boss
- [ ] New enemies: Tsubasa, BioBreaker, MX-1, Oblivian, Cutter.
- [x] Auto-bomb

## Changed
- [x] Some bullet hitboxes
- [x] Ship and Ship Options sprites
## Removed 
- [x] Trace option type
## Fixed
- [ ] Player Ship sometimes clipping out of the border. Can be fixed by doing a additional
hitbox to check if it's in collision with the border instead of using the ship's "core" as a hitbox
- [x] Stage 1 enemy spawns are no longer based on how much time
has passed, but are now based on the position of the "BG2" camera. 
This should fix some problems on lower end computers making enemies no longer spawn
earlier than they should.
